a)
The functions are incorporated into the code. So are the namespaces containing batch data. They are just above the main function.

b)
As far as I see it, the results are the same as in Group C, so long as N and Nsim are identical in each trial. This indicates the random number used in trials follows a particular pattern.(I understand they are not really random, but I don't expect them to behave exactly the same in each trial with same inputs).

SE and SD funcitons does not affect outcomes.

Generally, SD is relatively stable for each type of options with particular properties,whilst SE goes down as Nsim goes up.
