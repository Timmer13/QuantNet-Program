B
a)
The formulae are incorporated in class PerpAmeOption.
The two private functions CallPrice() and PutPrice() are programmed seperately as required.

They are made private because it is not necessary for the user to call different functions 
for different types of option. Also, as type is one of the innate parameter of a certain option,
it is natual to just call Price() to calculate its price.

b)
result: call:18.5035, put: 3.03106
No accuracy issue. RNG is not involved.

c)
Run the programme and the results are on the console.
It's possible to change the parameters through user input.
